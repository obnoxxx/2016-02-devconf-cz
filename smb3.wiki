New DCE/RPC Service to “witness” availability of other services, in particular SMB3 connections

* Allows Continuous Availability of SMB shares in clustered environments (together with persistent handles)
* Controlled way of dealing with reconnects instead of detecting failures due to timeouts
* Available with SMB3

Currently under development in Samba
* PoC implementation available, currently development on hold until new DCE/RPC async infrastructure is available
* WIP branch: \\ %
  https://git.samba.org/?p=gd/samba/.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/master-witness
