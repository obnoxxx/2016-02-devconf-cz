==== SMB3 ====

<[block]{SMB3 (2012) introduced SMB clustering:}
* Clustering - Witness
* Continuous Availability - Persistent Handles
* Scale Out
[block]>

<[block]{Additionally:}
* Transport encryption
* Multi-Channel
* RDMA transport (SMB Direct)
[block]>


==== SMB Features - in Samba ====

* SMB 2.0:
** durable file handles [4.0]
* SMB 2.1:
** multi-credit / large mtu [4.0]
** dynamic reauthentication [4.0]
** leasing [4.2]
** resilient file handles [PoC]
* SMB 3.0:
** new crypto (sign/encrypt) [4.0]
** secure negotiation [4.0]
** durable handles v2 [4.0]
** persistent file handles [planning/PoC]
** multi-channel [WIP++ (4.4...)]
** SMB direct [designed/starting]
** cluster features [designing]
*** witness [WIP+]
** storage features [WIP]
* SMB 3.1.1:
** basic support [4.3]


==== Witness - General ====

New DCE/RPC Service to “witness” availability of other services, in particular SMB3 connections
* Prompt and explicit notifications about failures in highly available systems
* Allows Continuous Availability of SMB shares in clustered environments (together with persistent handles)
* Controlled way of dealing with reconnects instead of detecting failures due to timeouts
* Available since SMB3 (Windows 8 / Windows Server 2012)
* More advanced failover mechanism than Tickle-ACK that is used within CTDB

==== Witness - Samba ====

Currently under development in Samba
* PoC implementation available
* Currently on hold until new DCE/RPC async infrastructure is available
* {\footnotesize @https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Samba3/ \\ %
   SMB2\#Witness\_Notification\_Protocol@}
* WIP branch: \\ %
  {\footnotesize @https://git.samba.org/?p=gd/samba/.git;a=shortlog; \\ %
   h=refs/heads/master-witness@}

Samba Witness service will cause Windows clients to reconnect:
* when client admin tool is used
* when CTDB (or any other cluster resource control manager) moves resources or IP addresses

==== Multichannel ====

What is multichannel?
* Bundling of NICs to increase throughput
* Support for RSS (Receive Side Scaling) capale interfaces
* So much more...


==== What's next ? ====

* SMB3 Multichannel (in Samba 4.4)
* SMB3 DCE/RPC Witness service
* SMB3 Persistent Handles / CA
* SMB Direct (SMB3 over RDMA)
* Multi-Protocol access (NFS,SMB...)
* SMB2+ Unix Extensions
