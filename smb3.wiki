==== SMB3 ====

Improvements of SMB3 over SMB2 include:
* Transport encryption
* SMB Direct (SMB over RDMA)
* SMB Multichannel (multiple connections per session)
* Witness Service (connection monitoring and transparent failover)

==== Witness - General ====

New DCE/RPC Service to “witness” availability of other services, in particular SMB3 connections
* Prompt and explicit notifications about failures in highly available systems
* Allows Continuous Availability of SMB shares in clustered environments (together with persistent handles)
* Controlled way of dealing with reconnects instead of detecting failures due to timeouts
* Available since SMB3 (Windows 8 / Windows Server 2012)
* More advanced failover mechanism than Tickle-ACK that is used within CTDB

==== Witness in Samba ====

Currently under development in Samba
* PoC implementation available, currently development on hold until new DCE/RPC async infrastructure is available
* WIP branch: \\ %
  https://git.samba.org/?p=gd/samba/.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/master-witness

Samba Witness service will cause Windows clients to reconnect:
* when client admin tool is used
* when CTDB (or any other cluster resource control manager) moves resources or IP addresses
