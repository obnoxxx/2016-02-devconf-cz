==== The Idea... ====

+<1->{
<[block]{Failover SMB clusters...}
Around 2006, it was quite customary to run Samba file servers in active-passive
failover clusters.

}

+<2->{
<[block]{Clustered file systems...}
At that time, quite a few distributed/clustered file systems
were available: gfs2, gpfs (IBM), GlusterFS, lustre, ocfs2, ...
[block]>
}

+<3->{
<[block]{New Idea...}
Can we create '''all-active''' SMB clusters on top of that with Samba?

==== from 2007 : CTDB - clustered Samba ====


<[block]{Samba+CTDB: pioneer in scale-out SMB}
* 2006: prototypes
* 2007: CTDB first usable version (with patched Samba)
* 2008: Samba 3.2 first experimental support
* 2009: Samba 3.3 official support
[block]>


==== Clustered SMB - Challenges ====

* SMB-clients not aware\! (Windows...) \\ %
==> All nodes must appear as '''one''' SMB server!
* Daemons must talk to each other cross-node. \\ %
==> How do samba daemons talk to each other on one node?
